    "title": "Fullstack Developer",
    "bio1": "I am a fullstack developer with 5 years of experience and a journey that began from the early days of Dimensão Sistemas, where I continue to contribute with maintenance and innovations. During this time, I have participated in all layers of development, which has given me a broad and practical view of the process as a whole.",
    "bio2": "In 2019, I started my education with a technical course in Systems Development and, after completing it, I continued with a technology degree in Systems Analysis and Development. Since then, I have been deepening my knowledge with practical courses at balta.io, Alura, and research in documentation. Throughout the journey, I have built a solid foundation in the main areas of development, because I believe that understanding the whole is essential to create complete and efficient solutions.",
    "bio3": "Despite my fullstack profile, it's in the front-end where I feel most at home. I enjoy creating beautiful, innovative, responsive, and user-centered interfaces, always with a mobile-first focus. Lately, I have been studying tools like Figma, Framer, and Adobe XD to bring design even closer and deliver experiences that really make sense for users."
